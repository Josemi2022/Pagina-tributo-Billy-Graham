        <p>Billy Graham preached the gospel of Christ in person to more than 80 million people and to untold millions more through television and radio.  Nearly 3 million people have responded to the invitation he offered at the end of his sermons (although this action turns out to be one of the most controversial features of his ministry today).  When America needed a pastor to help inaugurate, bury a president, or bring comfort in times of tragedy, they turned to him more often than not.<br><br>

 Virtually every year since the 1950s, he has appeared on lists of the ten most admired people in America or the world.</p>

      <h2 id="start">Start and Controversy</h2>
      <p>Born near Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1918, Billy Graham first attended Bob Jones School, but found the environment and Dr. Bob's strict rules unbearable.  So, he followed a friend to Florida Bible College, where he began preaching and changed his denominational affiliation from Reformed Presbyterian to Associated Southern Baptists.  To complete his intensive but academically limited education, he moved north to Wheaton College, where he met and married Ruth Bell, the daughter of a medical missionary, and undertook his first and only stint as a local pastor.

        <p>In 1945, Graham became the field representative of a dynamic evangelistic movement known as Youth for Christ International.  In this capacity, he toured the United States and much of Britain and Europe, teaching local church leaders how to organize youth rallies.  He also forged friendships with scores of Christian leaders who would later join his organization or provide critical assistance to his crusades when their respective cities were visited.<br><br>

 Graham became known and gained further notoriety through nationally publicized crusades in Los Angeles, Boston, Washington, and other major cities between 1949 and 1952, and through his radio program The Hour of Decision, started in 1950. Successful month-long evangelistic campaigns in London (1954) and New York (1957), tours of the Continent and the Far East, founding of the magazine Christianity Today (1956), launch of nationwide television broadcasts on ABC (1957), and public friendships with President Dwight Eisenhower and Vice President Richard Nixon cemented him as the recognized standard-bearer of evangelical Christianity he became.</p>

        <h2 id="fire">A Friendly Fire</h2>
        <p>As Graham's prestige and influence grew, particularly among "mainline" Christians, he drew criticism from fundamentalists, who saw his cooperation with churches affiliated with the National and World Council of Churches as indicating a commitment with the corrupting forces of modernism.  Bob Jones accused him of selling a "cheap kind of religion" and of "sacrificing the cause of evangelism on the altar of temporal expediency."  The final break with fundamentalism came in 1957, when, after accepting an invitation from the New York Protestant Council to hold a crusade in Madison Square Garden, Graham announced:</p>
<br>
        <p><b><i>"I intend to go anywhere, sponsored by anyone, to preach the gospel of Christ, if there are no strings attached to my message... The only mark of Christian discipleship is not orthodoxy, but love.  Christians are not limited to any church.  The only question is: are you committed to Christ?"</b></i>
        </p><br>
        <p>The New York Crusade marked another significant development in Graham's ministry.  At a time when boycotts were stirring racial tensions in the South, Graham invited Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to discuss the racial situation with him and his colleagues and lead the congregation in prayer.  The implication was unequivocal: Graham let both whites and African Americans know that he was willing to identify with the civil rights movement and its main leader, and King told his followers that Billy Graham was the ally of King. the.  Graham would never be comfortable with King's confrontational tactics;  still, his voice was important in declaring that a Christian racist was an oxymoron.

        <p>During the decade that spanned the presidencies of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, to which he had close and frequent access, Graham was often the target of critics who felt he should be bolder in his support of the civil rights movement and, later, , in his opposition to the Vietnam War.  The normally laudatory Charlotte Observer noted in 1971 that even some of Graham's fellow Southern Baptists considered him to be "...too close to the mighty and too fond of the things of the world, [and] have compared him to the prophets of God." ancient times they told the kings of Israel what they wanted to hear.”</p>

 <p>The evangelist enjoyed his association with presidents and the prestige it conferred on his ministry.  At the same time, presidents and other political luminaries clearly viewed his friendship with Graham as a valuable political asset.  During his re-election campaign, for example, Nixon instructed his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, to call Graham about once every two weeks, "...so that he doesn't feel that we're not interested in supporting his group in those key states where they can be useful”.  Following the Watergate scandal, Graham backed off a bit and began to warn of the temptations and pitfalls that await religious leaders entering the political arena.</p>

<p> When the movement known as the Religious Right emerged in the late 1970s, he refused to participate in it, warning his fellow Christian leaders to “be cautious in exerting political influence” lest they lose their spiritual impact.

        <h2 id="vision">Global Vision</h2>
        <p>As Graham became aware of his great influence, he became increasingly determined not only to help evangelicalism become ever more dynamic and self-confident, but also to shape the direction of contemporary Christianity.  That determination manifested itself in several large international conferences sponsored or underwritten in large part by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA).</p>

 <p>In particular, the 1966 World Congress on Evangelization in Berlin, attended by 1,200 evangelical leaders from 104 nations, and the 1974 International Congress on World Evangelization in Lausanne, Switzerland, attended by 2,400 delegates from 150 countries, helped evangelicals to see itself as a global Christian force, alongside Vatican II and the World Council of Churches, an international movement capable of achieving more than its constituents had ever dreamed of.</p>

 <p>Few, if any, developments in Billy Graham's ministry were more surprising or controversial than his success in penetrating the Iron Curtain.  Beginning in 1978, virtually every country controlled by the Soviet Union progressively granted him privileges that no other churchman, including the most prominent and politically docile native religious leaders, had received.  Graham took advantage of these visits to preach, encourage Christian believers, and explain to communist leaders that their restriction on religious freedom was counterproductive and hindered diplomatic relations with the United States.</p>

        <p>Graham's proudest achievements may be two BGEA-sponsored conferences in Amsterdam in 1983 and 1986, with a third in 2000. These meetings, attended by a total of 13,000 itinerant evangelists from 174 countries, provided basic instruction in such matters as sermon composition, fundraising, and the effective use of film and videotape.  As a sign of Billy Graham's spirit of change, approximately 500 attendees at the 1986 meeting were women, with Pentecostals outnumbering non-Pentecostals.  Subsequent smaller gatherings have provided similar training to thousands of other evangelists around the world.</p>

<p> In fact, it is plausible that the answer to the oft-asked question, "Who will be the next Billy Graham?", is not a single man or woman, but this mighty army of anonymous individuals whose spirits have been stirred by him. By the example of Billy Graham, their hands and minds have been prepared by the help of his organization, and their hearts have been set on fire by his resounding exhortation at the Amsterdam meetings: “Do the work of an evangelist!”</p>

        <p>Age and Parkinson's took their toll on him on February 21, 2018 in Montreat, North Carolina at the age of 99.  “My mind tells me I should get out on the street and go,” he said, as he began to feel the effects of his illness, “I just can't do it, but I'll preach until there's no breath left in my body.  I have been called by God, and until God tells me to retire, I will not.  As long as I live, all the strength I have, all the time that God allows me, I am going to dedicate it to doing the work of an evangelist.”
